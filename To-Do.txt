To-DO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1) The system generates a new game board (see mock up) (Populate with pices, new board) - Vara - Sunday September 13th

2) The user can move their piece - Stephen -  Tuesday September 16th

3) The system removes the opponent's piece when the user performs a jump - Cedric - Tuesday September 16th

4) The user's piece is kinged when they reach the opposite side of the board - Jessica -  Thursday September 18th
    ---> Plus updating other methods for King movements

5)The system should save the game to a text file when the user presses the 's' key - Cedric/Jess - Friday September 18th
6)The system should load the last saved game when the user presses the 'l' key - Cedric/Jess - Friday  September 18th

7)The source code should all be unit tested - Everyone for their own methods - 8pm-Friday  September 18th
